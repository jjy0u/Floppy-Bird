Elements of the game:
- Flappy bird: flappy just stays in when x coordinate but jumps by a set amount in the y axis when key/ click mouse click. When nothing is clicked, flappy just falls to his death, face first RIP.
- Pipes: move along the y coordinate until they reach flappy. If flappy touches the pipe, game over. Pipes sizes vary however gap size stays the same until you reach a higher level (?)
- Score: keeps count of how many pipes you pass 
- Score panel: when game over shows the score panel with your score (counts up to your score), best score, and a medal depending on your score. Eg bronze medal if you passed 10. Ok button and share button. Can also access this from start screen
- Pause button: self explanatory
- Start screen: start button and score button. When start is pressed gives a small tap tutorial


Plan:
1. First work with the elements sans animations, so have flappy as a dot and the pipes as rectangles just to prioritise functionality. Start with flappy and getting him moving up when on tap (click or key tap).
2. Have a few set pipes and figure out how to move them towards flappy
3. Figure out how to get the varying pipe sizes (with maintained gap) and for it to go continuously? Also figure out how to set the speed as this may be needed for higher levels
4. Make game end when flappy touches a pipe or hits the floor.
5. Keep a score count where a point is earned every time a pipe is passed
6. Store the highest score and display it as the best score. If score is > best score, best score = score
7. Display the score panel after loss
8. Button to start the game
9.  Button to redirect to start page from game over and a share button
10. Pause button and resume button.
11. Put in animations
